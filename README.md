## Simple CycleGAN realization with Pytorch
### [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kb7354/cyclegan/notebook)

This is a CycleGAN realiztion using Pytorch, mostly following the originally proposed architecture
([see here](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/)). It was trained using datasets of monet and vangogh
painting from the original paper.
